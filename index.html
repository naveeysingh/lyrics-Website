                        You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
                        I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

                        I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
                        And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
                        So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

                <h1>Justin Biber r</h1>
                <p>AJustin Bieber is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and pop icon who rose to fame in the late 2000s. 
                    Born on March 1, 1994, in London, Ontario, Canada, Bieber showed an early interest in music and
                     taught himself to play various instruments, including the guitar, piano, drums, and trumpet.

                    Bieber's breakthrough came in 2008 when he was discovered by Scooter Braun, a talent manager,
                     through his YouTube videos covering songs by artists like Usher, Ne-Yo, and Justin Timberlake. 
                     Braun introduced Bieber to Usher, who quickly signed him to Raymond Braun Media Group (RBMG), a 
                     joint venture between Braun and Usher, and then to a recording contract with Island Records..</p>
